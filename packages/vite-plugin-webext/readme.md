> A Vite plugin to generate cross-browser web extensions, available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera etc...

With this plugin, you can build a browser extension compatible with all browsers with modern technologies like typescript, tailwind and react.

## Features

- Supports manifest v3 & v2
- ES-module-based extension
- HTML and static assets handling
- HMR support in shadow-dom
- CSS compiling
- Support for sass, tailwind and more

## Getting started

Create a Vite project and install the package

```
npm install vite-plugin-webext
```

update the `vite.config.ts` like this

```typescript
// vite.config.ts

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import webExtension from 'vite-plugin-webext'
import manifest from './manifest'

export default return defineConfig({
  ...
  plugins: [
    webExtension({ manifest: manifest }),
  ],
})
```

## Typescript Support

Create an `env.d.ts` file, and add the following type reference to define the plugin-specific `import.meta` variables

```
// env.d.ts
/// <reference types="vite-plugin-webext/client" />
```

### Browser Support

The following requirements must be met by the browser:

- Must support dynamic module imports made by web extension content scripts.
- Must support `import.meta.url`

The plugin will automatically default to Vite's `build.target` config option to these minimum browser versions if not already defined by the user.

For dev mode support in Manifest V3, the Chromium version must be at least 110.

## How it works

The plugin will take the provided manifest, generate rollup input scripts for supported manifest properties, and then output an ES module-based web extension.

This includes:

- Generating and using a dynamic import wrapper script in place of original content scripts. Also adds the scripts to `web_accessible_resources` so they are accessible from `content-scripts`. This is because content scripts are not able to be loaded directly as ES modules.
- This may expose your extension to fingerprinting by other extensions or websites. Manifest V3 supports a [`use_dynamic_url` property](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/manifest/web_accessible_resources/) that will mitigate this. This option is set for manifest V3 web-accessible resources generated by this plugin.
- Modifying Vite's static asset handling to maintain `import.meta.url` usages instead of rewriting to `self.location` for wider browser support.
- Modifying Vite's HMR client to add support for targeting specific elements as style injection locations. Needed to support HMR styles in shadow DOM rendered content.
